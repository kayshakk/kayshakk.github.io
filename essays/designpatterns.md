## Creating the Blueprints

As most programmers know, reusing code is such a great way to save time and headaches. To take this a step further, programmers should start to create their own design patterns for their code. Design patterns refer to a set of solutions that can be used repeatedly to address common issues that arise during the development of an application or system. In short, a design pattern is a programming blueprint. The design pattern should provide a comprehensive description of the problem it addresses, the solution it offers, the circumstances under which it can be applied, and the resulting outcomes. It should also include implementation suggestions and illustrative examples.
