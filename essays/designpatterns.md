## Creating the Blueprints

As most programmers know, reusing code is such a great way to save time and headaches. To take this a step further, programmers should start to create their own design patterns for their code. Design patterns refer to a set of solutions that can be used repeatedly to address common issues that arise during the development of an application or system. In short, a design pattern is a programming blueprint. The design pattern should provide a comprehensive description of the problem it addresses, the solution it offers, the circumstances under which it can be applied, and the resulting outcomes. It should also include implementation suggestions and illustrative examples.




## My Experience

In my experience, I did enjoy using USLint even though it was a pain trying to get a single green check mark. A single green arrow means that your program runs nicely and there are no formatting issues. During a WOD, Workout of the Day, it is stressful to finish the program under a certain amount of time but it is even more stressful when you finish the program but there isn’t a single green check mark so you have to go back and correct your code. If you’re fast coding, ESLint will give you a run for your money. It will make sure that you finish your code while also maintaining the coding standards so you don’t have to go back and do it at the end.

Using coding standards and ESLint can not only make you a better programmer but also understand the programming language as well. It's one thing to just use the code to do what needs to get done but it's another thing to actually understand the code and use it with the correct formatting. In group projects, if everyone is using the same coding standards then almost everyone's programs will be uniformed in a way. This makes it easy for just about anyone in your group to understand your program even if you have your own coding style. 

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I believe using coding standards, ESLint, and WODs will help you to become a better programmer. If you can code fast while maintaining the coding standards you, in my opinion, have made it in life. An organized, understandable, and a green check marked program is the best program you can have. Coding standards are used to help with the organization of the program, ESLint helps to identify the formatting issues in your program, and WODs are used to help you become a fast programmer. With these three combined, you should be set to doing just about anything.
