The Native Hawaiian Science & Engineering Mentorship Program is a initiative dedicated to fostering the academic and professional development of Native Hawaiian students in the fields of science and engineering. This program offers invaluable mentorship and support, creating a strong foundation for students to pursue their passion for STEM disciplines. By connecting these students with experienced mentors, providing hands-on learning opportunities, and facilitating access to resources, the program helps bridge the gap in STEM representation and addresses the unique needs and perspectives of the Native Hawaiian community.

Among the NHSEMP's engaging events, one of my most cherished experiences was participating in STEM nights. During these events, we had the opportunity to instruct children ranging from Kindergarten to High School in crafting STEM projects, all while seamlessly integrating elements of Native Hawaiian culture into the learning process.
