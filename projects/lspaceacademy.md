The NASA Lucy Student Pipeline Accelerator and Competency Enabler (LSPACE) Academy is an extraordinary educational initiative offered by NASA to engage and inspire students interested in space exploration and science. Named after the Lucy mission, which is designed to study Trojan asteroids, the LSPACE Academy provides students with a unique opportunity to participate in a wide range of activities, workshops, and projects related to space science and engineering. The program encourages hands-on learning, innovation, and collaboration, allowing students to gain valuable experience in various STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Students are organized into teams consisting of 13 to 18 members, with each team tasked with creating an initial design report that outlines their proposed solution and ddives into the business, scientific, and engineering components of the project.
